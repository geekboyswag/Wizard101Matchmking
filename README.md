Wizard101 Matchmaking Proof Of Concept

I honestly have no clue why it's showing up as a different dev for the commits and authors, but he had nothing to do with this. I think my Eclipse is messed up and signing them as him, but this was coded entirely by justin393


How to use:

Download this: http://www.mediafire.com/download/daov2hd07hbp164/Matchmaking.jar
All that is, is the compiled version of the code you can see above, it just let's you run it on your computer

Once you have downloaded it, make a new folder on your desktop, and place the Matchmaking.jar you just downloaded into that folder.

Now we are going to create the script to run it
